# ccostr
Standard statistical methods for survival data should NOT be used for medical cost data, ccostr is an R package to calculate estimates of total costs with censored data based two commonly accepted estimators.




## Overview
The ccmean function implements 4 estimators, these are:

 - Naive "Available Sample"
 - Naive "Complete Case"
 - Bang and Tsiatis's method: *Bang and Tsiatis (2000)*
 - Zhao and Tian's method: *Zhao and Tian (2001)*



## Installation
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("HaemAalborg/ccostr")

# Or including a vignette that demonstrates the bias and coverage of the estimators
devtools::install_github("HaemAalborg/ccostr", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))
```




## Data format
Cost data should look something like this:
```{r echo=FALSE}
df_0 <- data.frame(id    = c("A", "B", "C"),
                   cost  = c(2544, 4245, 590),
                   delta = c(0, 0, 1),
                   surv  = c(343, 903, 445))
kable(df_0)
```



It is possible to get better estimates of the true mean if cost history is available. This cost data can be both discrete or continuous. If so the data should look something like this:
```{r echo=FALSE}
df_1 <- data.frame(id    = c("A", "A", "A", "B" ,"C", "C"),
                   start = c(1, 30, 88, 18, 1, 67),
                   stop  = c(1, 82, 88, 198, 5, 88),
                   cost  = c(550, 1949, 45, 4245, 23, 567),
                   delta = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1),
                   surv  = c(343, 343, 343, 903, 445, 445))
kable(df_1)
```


## Explanation of estimates
The package calculates two conventional but wrong estimates of the mean cost. The first is the available sample (AS) which divides total costs of all observations with the number of observations. This is correct if there is no censoring present. With censored data it is underestimating the real costs due to missing information. The second is the complete cases  (CC), here all incomplete cases is filtered out. This creates a bias towards short cases as they have a greater chance of not being removed, and this would normally also give a downward bias.

It is possible to come up with better estimates of the mean costs. The first is the estimator proposed by Bang and Tsiatis (BT) where complete cases are weighted with the probability of being censored at thier eventtime.

The BT estimator doesn't take account of cost history. This additional information is used in the estimator proposed by Zhao and Tian (ZT)

## Usage
First the function is used on the previous df
```{r message=FALSE}
library(ccostr)

df_1_res <- ccmean(df_1)

df_1_res
```

## Data simulation function
Data is now simulated with the simCostData function:
```{r}
# With the uniform distribution the true mean is 40.000, see documentation for further details.
sim <- simCostData(n = 1000, dist = "unif", censor = "heavy", L = 10)

sim_res <- ccmean(sim$censoredCostHistory)

print(sim_res)
```
